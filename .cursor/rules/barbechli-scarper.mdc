**Barbechli.tn Web Scraping Project**

## Project Overview
This project creates a web scraping system that collects product data from Tunisian e-commerce websites and provides it through a REST API for Barbechli.tn's price comparison service.

## Key Components

1. **Web Scraper (Using Playwright)**
   - Scrapes multiple Tunisian stores in barbechli (tunisianet, MyTek, mediavision, etc.)
   - Extracts: product names, prices, descriptions, categories, URLs, images, availability, seller info

2. **Database (Neon PostgreSQL)**
   - Stores all scraped product data
   - Tracks historical price changes

3. **REST API (FastAPI)**
   - Provides access to the collected data
   - Main endpoints:
     - GET /products - List all products with filtering options
     - GET /products/{id} - Get specific product details
     - GET /categories - Get available product categories
     - POST /scrape - Trigger a new scraping operation

## Implementation Requirements
- Use Playwright for browser automation and scraping
- Store data in Neon PostgreSQL
- Implement the API with FastAPI
- Version control with Git/GitHub
- Include requirements.txt for dependencies
- Document installation and usage instructions

## Project Goals
1. Create a comprehensive product database from Tunisian e-commerce sites
2. Maintain up-to-date product information with regular scraping
3. Provide a reliable and performant API for the Barbechli.tn website
